Java Integration
================

Perhaps the most important question is: How will my existing java code play with the new scala clases (and viceversa)?

You obviously don't want to re-write all your java code at once, but do a smooth migration. Or perhaps not at all and just keep you java code an start writing scala from now on.

I'll try to explain how java and scala can coexist, with code samples. Check them out.
